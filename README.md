# Ender Tap for Fabric-Carpet
For Minecraft <ins>1.19.2</ins>

*This mod is <ins>Server Side</ins> only. Therefore, you do not need it in your client if you want to use the mod with friends.

## How to use?
* In order to enable this mod. Run the command (and set it to default):<br/>
>/carpet enderTap true

* An owned ender chest (linked to a player) will be placed when you are sneaking.
  * The ender chest will link to the player who is placing it.
* A regular ender chest will be placed when you are <ins>not</ins> sneaking.

  *Please let me know of a better way of making the chest owned/unowned. I don't like how sneaking is how you make it owned. Seems too easy.
